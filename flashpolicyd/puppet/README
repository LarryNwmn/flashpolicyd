Puppet module to install flashpolicyd, file locations and init scripts are correct
for Red Hat Enterprise.  If you use this module you don't need to use the RPM

Copy the following files from the tarball to the module's file dir:

check_flashpolicyd.rb  
flashpolicy.xml  
flashpolicyd  
flashpolicyd.init

Then place the module in your puppet modules dir and include into your server:

node "somenode.you.com" {
	include flashpolicyd
}

To install the monitoring script on your nagios server do:

node "nagios.you.com" {
	include flashpolicyd::monitor
}

And configure nagios to use the plugin in /usr/local/bin/check_flashpolicyd.rb.
