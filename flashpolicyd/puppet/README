Puppet module to install flashpolicyd, file locations and init scripts are correct
for Red Hat Enterprise.

Copy the following files from the tarball to the module's file dir:

check_flashpolicyd.rb  
flashpolicy.xml  
flashpolicyd  
flashpolicyd.init

Then place the module in your puppet modules dir and include into your server:

node "somenode.you.com" {
	include flashpolicyd
}

To install the monitoring script on your nagios server do:

node "nagios.you.com" {
	include flashpolicyd::nagios
}

And configure nagios to use the plugin in /usr/local/bin/check_flashpolicyd.rb.
